# Lab 3 - Cleanup
You can keep the resources you've deployed in these labs running as long as you like.  If you used a free trial, eventually the credits in your account will be exhausted and they'll be automatically shutdown.  Alternatively, you can delete them by following these instructions.

## Delete AuraDS Professional Database
If you deployed a SaaS instance you can delete it in the console.  To do that, open the listing for Neo4j Aura in the Google Cloud console [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/prod.n4gcp.neo4j.io).  Click "MANAGE ON PROVIDER."

Click "OK" to confirm that you're ok to be redirected to the Aura console.

In the Aura console, clikc on the red garbage can icon in your "form13" instance.

Type "form13" in the dialog and clikc "Destroy" to delete your instance.

You'll then see a message that the instance is being destroyed.

A few seconds later, you should see a blank screen with no instances.  At this point, all billing for Neo4j Aura has ceased.

## Delete the Bucket
We also created a Google Cloud Storage Bucket.  To delete it, you can open Google Cloud Console [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  Under that open a Cloud Shell terminal and run the following command:

    gcloud alpha storage rm --recursive gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME

That will give you something like this:

## Delete Vertex AI Resources
We created a variety of Vertex AI resoruces.  The API is not quite there for gcloud yet.  So, the easiest thing to do is probably just to login to the console [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) and delete them manually.  You'll want to delete the following:

* [Managed Notebook](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench/managed)
* [Datasets](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets)
* [Training Pipelines](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/training/training-pipelines)
* [Models](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/models)
