# Signup for Google Cloud
For this lab you'll need both a Google and a Google Cloud account.  If you don't have accounts or if they are restricted so you can't deploy things, you can follow these steps to create a free trial.

You'll need to provide your phone number and credit card information.  New Google Cloud accounts come with a $300 credit. Total costs for the lab should be significantly under $50. At the end of the lab we'll show you how to delete any resources you've deployed as well.

## Improving the Labs
As you work through these labs, we'd really appreciate your feedback.  One way to help us improve is to open an issue by going [here](https://github.com/neo4j-partners/hands-on-lab-neo4j-and-vertex-ai/issues).  Outright bugs, usability suggestions, and general comments are all appreciated.  Pull requests are great too!

## Activate your Google Cloud account
Now that you have an account, you need to activate it.  That will allow you to use the $300 free trial credits.  Click "ACTIVATE" at the top of the console.

Select an answer for "What best describes your organization or needs?"  I chose "Other." Then review the terms, accept them and click "CONTINUE."

Select "Individual" for account type.  You'll need to enter a credit card number.  This number will not be charged unless you change your billing options explictly to bill it.  The card is used solely to verify your identity.

Once you've entered your information click "START MY FREE TRIAL."

![](images/12-activate.png)

You'll see a questionaire dialog you can dismiss by clicking "CLOSE."

You can dismiss the tutorial dialog by clicking "SKIP FOR NOW."  Click the "X" to dismiss the "Now viewing project "My First Project" in organization "No organization" dialog.

That should give you a console that's ready to use.

You have $300 in credits to use over 90 days.  Your credit card will not be billed unless you change your billing options.

In the next lab we'll deploy Neo4j using the account you just created.
